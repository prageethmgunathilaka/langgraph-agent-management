## 🎮 How to Use

### 🚀 Manual Quality Gate Execution

1. **Via GitHub Web Interface**:
   - Go to: `https://github.com/prageethmgunathilaka/langgraph-agent-management/actions`
   - Select "Extreme Quality Gate"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Choose branch (default: master)
   - Click "Run workflow" button

2. **Via GitHub CLI** (if installed):
   ```bash
   gh workflow run quality-gate.yml
   ```

### 📊 Monitoring Quality

1. **Workflow Results**: Check Actions tab for detailed reports
2. **Coverage Reports**: Uploaded to Codecov automatically
3. **Security Reports**: Available in workflow artifacts
4. **Performance Reports**: Benchmark results in workflow logs

### 🔧 Local Development

1. **Install Pre-commit** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. **Manual Quality Checks**:
   ```bash
   # Code formatting
   black --check .
   isort --check-only .
   
   # Linting
   flake8 .
   pylint app/
   
   # Type checking
   mypy app/
   
   # Security scanning
   bandit -r app/
   safety check
   
   # Testing
   pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
   ```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow Failures**:
   - Check workflow logs in Actions tab
   - Review specific step failures
   - Verify API keys are set in repository secrets

2. **Pre-commit Issues**:
   - Ensure Python environment is activated
   - Install missing dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Update pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit autoupdate`

3. **Coverage Issues**:
   - Ensure tests are properly configured
   - Check test discovery patterns
   - Verify coverage configuration in pyproject.toml

## 🎉 Next Steps
