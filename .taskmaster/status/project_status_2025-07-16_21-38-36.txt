- **Priority**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: Task 3 ✅ (completed)
- **Status**: Ready to implement with finalized architecture approach

## 🏗️ FINALIZED ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### Agent Communication Strategy - CONFIRMED
**Final Decision**: **Internal Service Method Calls** (NOT HTTP endpoints)

### Architecture Benefits Confirmed
- **Performance**: 10-100x better performance (no HTTP overhead)
- **Simplicity**: Simpler codebase maintenance and debugging
- **Type Safety**: Direct Python type checking and atomic operations
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale later to microservices when needed
- **Error Handling**: Better error handling with native exceptions

### Implementation Plan Finalized
1. **AgentConnectionService Class** - New dedicated service for agent connections
2. **Internal Method Calls** - Direct Python method calls for communication
3. **Task Delegation System** - Method-based task delegation functionality
4. **Connection Management** - Validation and management of agent connections
5. **Event Logging** - Comprehensive audit trails for all operations

## 🛠️ Task 4 Implementation Requirements (UPDATED)

### Core Service Methods
- **AgentConnectionService** with methods:
  - `connect_agents()` - Connect agents bidirectionally
  - `disconnect_agents()` - Remove agent connections
  - `get_connected_agents()` - List connected agents

### Task Delegation Methods
- `delegate_task()` - Assign tasks to connected agents
- `spawn_child_task()` - Create new tasks for child agents
- `notify_task_completion()` - Update parent agents on task completion

### Status Communication Methods
- `update_agent_status()` - Internal status updates
- `broadcast_status_change()` - Notify connected agents of status changes

### Validation & Management
- Connection validation and integrity checks
- Circular dependency prevention
- Parent-child relationship management
- Event logging for audit trails
