🚀 NEXT STEPS
1. Start Task 2 - Implement Workflow Management
   - Create/delete workflows with unique IDs
   - Workflow acts as container for agents
   - API endpoints for workflow CRUD operations

💡 REMINDER FOR NEXT TIME
Tell me: "We completed and tested Task 1 (project structure setup) and are ready to start Task 2 (workflow management). The foundation is solid with FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph dependencies, configuration, logging, and error handling all implemented and verified working."

🎯 MVP APPROACH CONFIRMED
Following the recommended MVP progression:
1. ✅ Foundation - Project structure & dependencies (TESTED & WORKING)
2. 🔄 Workflow Management - Next up
3. Agent Creation - After workflows
4. Agent Connectivity - Inter-agent communication
5. Intelligence - Task delegation & spawning

📊 TASK STATISTICS
- Total Tasks: 8
- Completed: 1 (12.5%) - FULLY TESTED
- Pending: 7 (87.5%)
- Subtasks Completed: 5/5 (100%) for Task 1 - ALL TESTED
