   - Different intelligence levels
   - Error handling and recovery

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Day 3)
1. **Enhanced Agent Types**
   - Implement 5 agent types within LangGraph nodes
   - API, Data, File, Notification, General agents
   - Maintain existing functionality with simpler code

2. **Persistence Integration**
   - Use LangGraph's built-in checkpointing
   - Remove custom SQLite persistence layer
   - Automatic workflow state recovery

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Leverage LangGraph's parallel execution
   - Optimize LLM usage with built-in caching
   - Remove custom retry and error handling

## Implementation Details

### LangGraph Service Architecture

```python
# Current: 2,805 lines across 6 files
# New: ~500 lines in 1 file

class LangGraphService:
    # Built-in state management (replaces persistence_service.py)
    checkpointer = MemorySaver()
    
    # Simplified LLM integration (replaces llm_service.py)
    llm_models = self._initialize_llm_models()
    
    # Node-based execution (replaces task_service.py + agent_service.py)
    async def planning_node(self, state) -> state
    async def execution_node(self, state) -> state
    async def decision_node(self, state) -> str
    async def recovery_node(self, state) -> state
    async def completion_node(self, state) -> state
```

### Workflow Definition

```python
# Current: Complex custom orchestration
# New: Simple LangGraph workflow

workflow = StateGraph(WorkflowState)
workflow.add_node("planning", self.planning_node)
workflow.add_node("execute", self.execution_node)
workflow.add_node("recovery", self.recovery_node)
workflow.add_node("complete", self.completion_node)

workflow.add_edge(START, "planning")
workflow.add_edge("planning", "execute")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("execute", self.decision_node)
workflow.add_edge("complete", END)

compiled_workflow = workflow.compile(checkpointer=self.checkpointer)
```

## API Comparison

### Current API (Complex)
- 15+ endpoints across multiple routers
- Complex request/response handling
- Custom error management
- Manual state tracking

### LangGraph API (Simplified)
- 6 core endpoints
- Simplified request/response models
- Built-in error handling
- Automatic state management

```python
# New simplified endpoints
POST /v2/workflows/create          # Create workflow
POST /v2/workflows/{id}/execute    # Execute workflow
GET  /v2/workflows/{id}/status     # Get status
DELETE /v2/workflows/{id}          # Cancel workflow
POST /v2/workflows/quick-execute   # Create + execute
GET  /v2/system/metrics           # System metrics
```

## Migration Risks and Mitigation

### Risks
1. **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand LangGraph concepts
2. **Dependency**: Adding external dependency on LangGraph
3. **Feature Parity**: Ensuring all current features work in LangGraph

### Mitigation
1. **Parallel Development**: Keep existing system running during migration
2. **Gradual Migration**: Implement new endpoints alongside existing ones
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure feature parity before switching
4. **Documentation**: Document new architecture thoroughly

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual LangGraph nodes
- Mock LLM responses for consistent testing
- Test state transitions and error handling

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end workflow execution
- Multiple intelligence levels
- Error recovery scenarios

### Performance Tests
- Compare execution times with current system
- Test parallel execution capabilities
- Memory usage and resource optimization

## Rollback Plan

1. **Maintain Current System**: Keep existing routes active during migration
2. **Feature Flags**: Use configuration to switch between implementations
3. **Data Backup**: Ensure workflow state can be migrated back if needed
4. **Monitoring**: Track performance and error rates during transition
